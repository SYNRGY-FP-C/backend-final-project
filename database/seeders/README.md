# Seeders

Sequelize seeder files are just like model files. They are stored in the `seeders` directory and are named according to the convention `XXXXXXXXXX-name-of-seeder.js`, where `XXXXXXXXXX` is a timestamp. The timestamp is used to order the seeders and guarantee that they are run in the correct order.
